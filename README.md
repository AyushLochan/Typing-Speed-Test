# Typing Speed Test

This is a simple **Typing Speed Test** web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to test their typing speed (Words Per Minute) and accuracy as they type a provided text. The timer starts as soon as the user types the first character, and the test ends when the user completes the sentence correctly.

## Features

* **Words Per Minute (WPM)**: Displays the typing speed based on words typed per minute.
* **Accuracy**: Shows the typing accuracy as a percentage.
* **Error Count**: Tracks the number of incorrect characters typed.
* **Timer**: Displays the elapsed time (in seconds) while typing.
* **Reset**: Resets the test to allow users to try again.
* **New Text**: Provides a random sentence from a list for users to type.

## How to Use

1. Open the **index.html** file in your browser.
2. The test text will appear on the screen. Start typing the provided text into the text area.
3. The **timer** will start as soon as you type the first character.
4. Your **typing speed (WPM)** and **accuracy** will be updated in real-time.
5. If you make mistakes, they will be counted in the **error count**.
6. Once you finish typing the full sentence correctly, the timer will stop, and you can reset or start a new test.

### Buttons:

* **Reset**: Resets the test to start fresh.
* **New Text**: Chooses a random text from the provided list.
